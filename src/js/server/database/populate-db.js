I have an on-time pickup guarantee which means if you're not picked up on time you get a $50 discount on that trip, not a future credit. You can't do better anywhere.
        \n\nIf you are looking for a spacious, clean and comfortable trip then calling me is the only number you need to know. Rates start at $60 and hourly packages are available for your special events. There is never a surge charge, you will know your full fee when your trip is confirmed regardless of how far in advance your service is booked. I now have a Mercedes Sprinter with an 11 passenger capacity also available for larger party pick ups at the airport or for special events.`,
